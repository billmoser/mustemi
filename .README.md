## MUSTEMI - MUSic ThEory for MIdi applications
This package provides the means to produce Midi note numbers from either numeric degrees relative to a given scale, note names (eg 'C', 'Eb'), chord names (eg 'Cm7b5'), or Nashville numbers.  There are examples for each of these given below, as well as a couple of examples of using this package with
a midi controller and a DAW.  This package can be used both in a node application and in the browser.

## Installation

```sh
npm install mustemi
```

## Basic Examples
These demonstrate how to use the package to produce MIDI note numbers from
scale degrees.
```javascript
{"gitdown": "include", "file": "./examples/basic-examples.js"}
```

## Chord Examples
In these examples, you'll see how to do the same for named chords.
```javascript
{"gitdown": "include", "file": "./examples/chord-examples.js"}
```

## Nashville Number System
These examples show how to produce MIDI note numbers from Nashville notation.
```javascript
{"gitdown": "include", "file": "./examples/nashville-examples.js"}
```

# MIDI examples
Here's a simple example of using the package to output MIDI for consumption
by a DAW or some other MIDI-aware sound engine such as Kontakt Player.  This
uses a few basic midi utilities in the *examples* directory of this package.
Your OS will need to have a way to open a virtual MIDI device.  On the platform I'm using, Windows 10, this is made possible by using a 3rd-party
tool such as the one I use:
 [LoopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)
```javascript
{"gitdown": "include", "file": "./examples/midi-examples.js"}
```

# Simple MIDI chord arpeggiator
In this example, we take input from a MIDI keyboard, and output arpeggios rooted at the notes received from the keyboard.
```javascript
{"gitdown": "include", "file": "./examples/midi-play-example.js"}
```
